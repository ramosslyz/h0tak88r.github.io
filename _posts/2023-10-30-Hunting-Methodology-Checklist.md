- [ ] evil@a.com changes mail to 2@gmail.com (owned) -> gets email verification link -> sends link to victim, victim opens and victims account email is updated
- [ ] Change email Confirmation link not expired + OAUTH misconfiguration = ATO
	1. go to account settings and change mail address to [victim](mailto:victim@gmail.com)2[@gmail.com](mailto:victim111@gmail.com)
	2. a link will be sent to [victim](mailto:victim@gmail.com)2[@gmail.com](mailto:victim111@gmail.com), now the user realizes that he have lost access to [victim](mailto:victim@gmail.com)2[@gmail.com](mailto:victim111@gmail.com) due to some reasons
	3. so he will probably change mail to the another mail address for e.g [victim3@gmail.com](mailto:victim999@gmail.com) which he owns and has access to
	4. but it is found that even after verifying victim3@gmail.com, the old link which was sent to victim2@gmail.com is active, so user/attacker having access to that mail can verify it and Observe the OAuth misconfiguration that leads to account takeover

- [ ] Link Account with Gmail and copy the response -> Attacker request to link with victim gmail -> intercept the response and paste the response from step 1

> ***Testing [[Authorization-Schema]]***

- [ ] Use <span style="color:#06ea6c">account-A</span>'s Cookie/ Authorization-token to access <span style="color:#06ea6c">account-B</span>'s Resources/Objects

- [ ] [[CSRF]] for unsubscribe option
- [ ] [[XSS]]  `https://testbuguser.myshopify.com/?contact[email]%20onfocus%3djavascript:alert(%27xss%27)%20autofocus%20a=a&form_type[a]aaa`

>***[[2FA Feature]] Abuse***

- [ ] Weak 2FA Implementation > <span style="color:#06ea6c">2FA Secret Cannot be Rotated</span>  
    Rotating the secret means changing this key periodically to enhance security. If the 2FA secret cannot be rotated, it means that once the secret is compromised, an attacker could potentially gain ongoing access to the account without the user’s knowledge, as there is no way for the user to change the secret.

- [ ] <span style="color:#06ea6c">Missing 2FA Code Integrity Validation</span>
- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Bypass 2FA with null or 000000 or Blanc</span>
- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">2FA Referrer Check Bypass | Direct Request</span>
- [ ] Complete the 2FA with your account but do not access the next part, Access it using the victim's Session who still into 2FA page -> <span style="color:#ffc000">2FA Bypassed</span>
- [ ] <span style="color:#ffc000">Changing the 2FA mode Leads to Bypass the code</span>
- [ ] [Race Condition](https://hackerone.com/reports/1747978)

- [ ] Test <span style="color:#ff0000">JWT secret brute-forcing</span>
	`python3 jwt_tool.py <JWT> -C -d <Wordlist>`
- [ ] Abusing <span style="color:#ff0000">JWT Public Keys Without knowing the Public Key</span>
	`https://github.com/silentsignal/rsa_sign2n`
- [ ] <span style="color:#ff0000">Test if algorithm could be changed</span>
	- Change algorithm to None `python3 jwt_tool.py <JWT> -X a`
	- Change algorithm from RS256 to HS256 
	  `python3 jwt_tool.py <JWT> -S hs256 -k public.pem`
	- algorithm confusion with no exposed key -> `docker run --rm -it portswigger/sig2n <token1> <token2>`
- [ ] Test if <span style="color:#ff0000">signature is being validated</span> 
	 `python3 jwt_tool.py <JWT> -I -pc <Key> -pv <Value>`
- [ ] <span style="color:#06ea6c">Test token expiration time</span> (TTL, RTTL) -> change `exp:`
